Gmail has a feature called "Smart Reply," where users can select from a list of recommended responses when replying to an email. But Gmail doesn't allow you to create your own smart replies. _Smarter_ Reply for Gmail is a Chrome extension which does let you create custom replies, and will learn to recommend the right reply for a given email.
